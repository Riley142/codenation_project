                    <h4>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Safety - Cyber security</li>
                        <li>Organization/ Planning</li>
                        <li>Enables small business to be visble</li>
                        <li>Helps to grow businesses</li>
                        <li>Allowes to contact people from around the world better than ever before</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>The basis of all of the succesful project is a good preparation and a proper plan. With the use of tools 	such as: "Trello"/"Jira" we can plan our work and share it with our teammates. Next, we need to manage 	the project with flexible mind, dividing the job accordingly to the persons needs and abilities. The 	project manager needs to check on the team to assure that there will be no delays and everything runs 	smoothly. Finally, after the project is finished it should be put out to testing and the feedback should be 	given to the team, if there are wny issues to be fixed. You should be not only organised, knowladgable 	but also creative and approchable.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.</h4>

                    <h4>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Failing to plan</li>
                        <li>Lack of effective communication</li>
                        <li>Copyright issues</li>
                        <li>Not testing resulting in errors in the code</li>
                        <li>Overdoing, which can  fail to meet the deadline</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h4>
                    <p>For backend projects I would probably use linux as it is the most common among dev ops/backend devs. The language would depend on the type of project, but mostly I would use javascript as it is one of the most popular ones and the one I am most familiar with.
                    <br>
                    Frontend projects could be done on any of the OS, I'm usually working on windows/linux. My favourite tool is vscode as it has very useful plugins – build in emmet which makes writing code faster, live server which enables You to see all the changes done on the website as soon I You save it without needing to reopen. The stack on frontend project  always is: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. If needed I would use CSS pre processors - SCSS or frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap. To make things better I'd choose right frameworks/libraries for javascript – React/Angular/Vue.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4 id="outc3">Describe and provide analysis on how Your chosen technologies have helped you achieve Your outcomes. How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using <strong>HTML</strong> helps build the "skeleton" of a website & add all the text content, links, lists etc.</li>
                        
                        <li>Using <strong>CSS</strong> helps makes the website looks nice, edit everything from the layout, fonts and colours to any media added and even animations</li>
                       
                        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> is the muscles or should I say the brain of the web page. <br> I can control anything in both HTML & CSS and make website more interactive and responsive byt controling the DOM.</li>
                        
                        <li>Using <strong>Trello</strong> helped with planning the project and tracking the progress. <br>I have not used it before but it will stay for good even for non tech related planning. </li>
                        
                            <li><strong>GitHub</strong> & <strong>GIT</strong>  are one of the most important technologies a developer can use.<br> Using version control allows me to save myu project (repo) in the cloud and have a backup & feel safe. 
                            <br><strong>GitHub pages</strong> are an amazing tool that allows us to share our website and keep it online to share without a need to buy a domain or hosting.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h4 id="gdpr">Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h4>
                    <p>GDPR is very important and data safety should always be a priority, however it can hinder the progress of the project as the data needs to be accesed can be stored among different people that we would need to contact, instead at one accessible place. <br>The safety of the data is also dependent on what we do after the project is finished and how we dispose the data we don't need. <br>GDPR regulations, can also make some parts of the project impossible to complete if We can't make sure they will be a 100% secure.</p>

                <div class="u1outcome2">
                    <h2>Outcome 2</h2>
                    <h4>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello  </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using <strong>Trello</strong> helped with planning the project and tracking the progress. <br>I have not used it before but it will stay for good even for non tech related planning. </li>
                        <li><strong>VSCode</strong> is extremly helpfull. Build in emmet helps to write code faster, live server plugin allows me to see the changes I do on the website "live" without a need to refresh a website all the time.</li>
                        <li>Another useful tools for me are <strong>Adobe Photoshop & Adobe Xd</strong> they help me resize images/graphics change colours, build a coulur pallete and build a website before I will actually write the code. Design isn't easy and the visual really helps with creating a good looking app.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello  </h4>
                    <p>I couldn't imagine working without VSCode, even though there's many other programs.
                        All the plugins and even the theme and the fonts and colorfull snippets help me to code.</p>
                    <p>I would not expect Trello to be as useful as it was - especially when planning the page before writing any code.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your ﬁnal project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h4>

                    <h5>Strengths</h5>
                    <p>I think I have done pretty well. I think thue code i write is readable and clean. I really like CSS and being able to do onclick events etc. in JavaScript, few lines of code can change so much!<br>My main focus was to create a clean  & responsible webpage.</p><br>

                    <h5>Weaknesses</h5>
                    <p>My weaknesses is digging in too deep sometimes. I often find myself trying to use something I have not use before which can result in too much time taken off the main thing. Buut I'm aware of that. All the new (well almost all!) shiny things are ending up on sticky notes on my wall to try it out in other projects.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h5>What would I change</h5>
                    <p>If I would have more time, I'd add some animations.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h4> 
                    <p>I can add some animations, maybe some graphics, more than just few svg waves :)
                        <br> Maybe some more JavaScript events to make website more interactive.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are ﬁt for purpose </h4>
                    <p>Reviewed, I hope it's all good.</p>
                    <br></br>

                <div class="u1outcome3">
                    <h2>Outcome 3</h2>

                    <h4> Review the beneﬁts and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h4>
                    <br>

                    <h5>Usefulnes of the tools</h5>
                    <p>Like I described in <a href="#outc3" class="plink">Outcome 2</a> I found all of the tools used very useful.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h5>Could I be more efficient?</h5>
                    <p>I could be more efficient If I could have prepared all of the written content first before I made the "Project" part of the website. It was hard to create not knowing what to include inside.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h5>Could you have done it in teams?</h5>
                    <p>Yes of course! It would take some extra time to plan and divide the tasks between the team mates. All tough I feel like in such a small project it's easier to work alone.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h4>
                    <p>More planning ahead. Especially when it comes to responsive layout of the page, I changed it few times during writing the code.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use of <strong>Slack</strong> for smaller lower priority things & sharing files.</li>
                        <li><strong>Zoom</strong> can help as You can have proper conversation and it's easier to communicate.</li>
                        <li>It can also help with "live coding" or sharing any ideas, presentations using share screen function.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Since it's a small page I decided to go with the one page design.</li>
                    <li>I kept it pretty simple with a small logo and plain responsive navbar.</li>
                    <li>I've made a big header showing some nice svg waves.</li>
                    <li>Than the project content itself. I split it in  unit 1 & 2</li>
                    <li>I put text content of the outcomes in seperate boxes to make it look cleaner</li>
                    <li>Than I created a small section for About Me part</li>
                    <li>Added social icons & a small contact form so everyone can contact me without the need to open their email page.</li>
                    <li>Finished with a small footer in a svg wave. With a link to the top of the page.</li>

        <p><strong>Hi, I'm Riley!</strong>
            <br>I'm a aspiring Front-End Developer based in Manchester, UK. I'm a self tought developer, who can't wait do learn another skill! Since my first hello world I fell in love with programming. I'm also a photographer and know my way around Adobe programs. Few years back I was learning groups of people basics of photography & Photoshop which was my fav thing to do untuil I discovered programming! I always loved computers and new software & hardware, new games. Since I was a kid I wanted to build my own computer, instead of buying a laptop. I always tried to fix things, especialy all the electronics, so now instead of bendin CPU pins I can break a program, yay! I'm also a rock music lover, and myself play guitar and bass guitar, not to good at it, luckily never been in a proper band so not too many people had to hear that noise :)</p>
